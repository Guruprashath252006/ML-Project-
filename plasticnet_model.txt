This is a placeholder.

To deploy your app, you must upload your trained model file named exactly:
plasticnet_model.pth

Steps:
1. Train your model and save it using:
   torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'plasticnet_model.pth')

2. Upload 'plasticnet_model.pth' along with 'app.py' and 'requirements.txt' to your GitHub repo.

3. Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces using Gradio.

Note:
Ensure your 'app.py' loads the model using the same architecture and file name.
